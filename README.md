# About Me

Hi! I'm thefool309 and I'm a Computer Science Graduate and Software Developer.

I love Linux, and C++. I'm into Software Development Tools, Cybersecurity, and Web Development. I am proficient in C++, Python, and Java; with additional experience in C#, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and x86-64 Assembly.

I've played around with some web development, but my heart lies with low level programming, and working with Operating Systems. My goal is to contribute to the linux kernel one day, and give back to the operating system I use most.

I’m currently working on [civ-sculptor](https://github.com/thefool309/civ-sculptor) A simulation of civilizations interacting on a procedurally generated map, meant to generate data for machine learning algorithms, and researching the simulation itself. The Ultimate goal of this software is to provide producable data that can be used to train ML or RL agents to run through the simulation as one of the civilizations.
